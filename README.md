LinFo is a lightweight Linux system information and security enumeration tool designed for quick, comprehensive insights into a target systemâ€™s hardware, software, and security posture. It is intended for use by system administrators, penetration testers, and security researchers who need an efficient way to gather system details and identify potential security weaknesses.

## Features

- Collects detailed OS and kernel information.
- Reports CPU, GPU, memory, disk usage, and package count.
- Detects desktop environment and display resolution.
- Enumerates network interfaces and IP/MAC addresses.
- Provides an extensive security report covering firewall status, SELinux/AppArmor, kernel hardening features, SUID binaries, permissions, listening ports, and more.
- Gathers "loot" relevant for red team operations: suspicious cron jobs, writable directories, SSH authorized keys, shell startup files, and recently modified binaries.
- Interactive prompts for saving scan or loot reports to file.
- Supports running with or without root privileges, with full functionality recommended under root.
- Command-line options for scanning, loot gathering, or both combined.

## Installation

Clone or download the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kaotickj/LinFo.git
cd LinFo
chmod +x linfo.sh
````

Run the script directly on the target Linux system.

## Usage

```
Usage: linfo.sh [OPTIONS]

Options:

  --quiet               Run script in quiet mode (minimal output).
  --no-ip               Skip displaying network interface IP addresses.
  --raw                 Output raw, uncolored text for easier parsing.
  --scan                Perform security scanning checks and display a security report.
  --loot, --c2ready     Gather potential loot, indicators, and staging areas for C2 readiness.
  --fullscan            Run both --scan and --loot checks; skips IP info for speed.
  --help, -h            Show this help message and exit.

Examples:

  ./linfo.sh --scan
      Run only the security scan report.

  ./linfo.sh --loot
      Run loot gathering report.

  ./linfo.sh --fullscan
      Run full security and loot reports in one execution.
```

## Notes

* Running with root privileges (e.g., via `sudo`) is recommended to ensure full scan accuracy and access to all system information.
* The loot report can be very detailed; the script will prompt to save output to a file if desired.
* The script attempts to detect various kernel hardening features and potential security risks, but some checks depend on kernel version and system configuration.
* Designed for Linux environments only.
